# Fjellvarden

Small consulting firm. Strategy and web development.

We listen, ask questions, then build. Every project is custom – we choose the right technology for the problem, not the other way around. Whether that's Astro, plain HTML, eCommerce CMS, PHP, or something else entirely.

We're not a template shop. We build websites and tools for businesses that want to move forward. Performance, accessibility, and clean code aren't afterthoughts. They're the baseline.


### Why we share code

We use open source every day. Sharing our own tools is how we give back. Everything here is code we actually use in production – built for speed, tested in real projects.

Use it if it helps. Found an issue? Contributions are welcome.
